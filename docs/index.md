# Hey ! Welcome to my portfolio, where you'll find my resume, notes about my learning journey as well as my projects related to Software Engineering. 

<p>
I'm a <b>software engineer</b> that is currently working in R&D in the automotive industry in Japan. I am interested in automotive software (ADAS and Autonomous driving), robotics, and computer vision. Passionate about sharing and empowering students during my university days, I volunteered for IEEE student chapter of my university to organize tech related events. <br> Hobbies:üèÄ,üèê,üéß.
