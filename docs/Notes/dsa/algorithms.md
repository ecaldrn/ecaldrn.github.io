# Algorithms
A problem can be seen as a binary relationship between input(s) and output(s). In order to solve complex, computational problems, capable to take an arbitrary number of inputs, we need to learn about algorithm design. 

## What is an algorithm ?
An **algorithm** is a well defined procedure to solve accomplish a desired specific task (solving a problem, sorting data, etc.). To accomplish the task in hand, the algorithm will take as input one value or a set or values, and will return one value or a set of values as output. This processing is done in a finite amount of time. 

We can also think about an Algorithm as the required computational steps that will transform the problem's input into output, this is a function f that maps input I to output O. 

### When an algorithm is correct ?
An algorithm is correct if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts-finishes its computing in finite time- and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance [^1].

## Why it is necessary to learn algorithms ?
Because by learning about algorithm design, we can identify which procedure is the optimal for our task/data at hand, evaluate our solution, and prove that the algorithm is both correct and efficient.

Also, if the problem gets more complex, or the quantity of input data increases, we can make the necessary changes so the performance is not impacted. 

Finally, the knowledge of algorithms gives us the tools and objective expressions necessary to communicate our solution to others regardless the programming language or the hardware in which the solution will be implemented.
