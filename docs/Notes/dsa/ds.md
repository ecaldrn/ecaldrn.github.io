# Data structures

Depending on the task in hand, the solution can be simplified (and optimized) by choosing the right layout for the existing data. Thats where data structures appear, by giving us specific ways to store our data so we can process and access data in an efficient way. Then we can define a Data Structure as a "systematic way of organizing and processing information" [^1].
